# Overcome Your Challenges Today

</div>

<div class="visitor" markdown="1">

<div markdown="1">

**Prototype** passes bench tests but fails in production:

- intermittent sensor drift on assembly, 
- inconsistent calibrations, 
- no repeatable test fixture, 
- first 100 units failing environmental/EMC checks.

</div>

<div markdown="1">

**Scaling startup** and ramping from pilot to 1k+/month: 

- yield drops when set to higher throughput, 
- operator-dependent assembly steps, 
- missing SOPs and test jigs, 
- sudden supplier part variances breaking line flow.

</div>

<div markdown="1">

**Upgrade & retrofit.** Legacy line requires a new product variant: 

- 90-minute changeovers, 
- robotic cell misalignment causing scrap, 
- obsolete spare parts, 
- inability to integrate automated inspection without major CAPEX.

## Project Showcase {#my-work-portfolio}

- **Hobby-size** (personal, non-commercial, one-time solution)
- **Small** (hand-held prototype or product)
- **Medium** (industrial solution, QMS involved)
- **Big** (CAPEX, strategic, safety involved)

- ### **Bicycle Lock Holder**

    <img src="img/Bike_lock_holder.png" alt="design-optimisation-bicycle-lock-holder" loading="lazy" class="prj-image">

    **Scale:** Hobby

    In this project I overcome bicycle frame limitations and adjusted to user riding style. Inspiration of the design came from open-source designs on Thingiverse.com and Printables.com.

- ### **Measuring Fixture**

    <img src="img/meas_dev.PNG" alt="production-quality-control-design-jig-fixture" loading="lazy" class="prj-image">

    **Scale:** Medium

    Quality control tool for periodic dimensional and tolerance check of special product characteristic in serial production. Fixture adapted for regular production personnel with minimal training needed.

- ### **Automatic Assembly Line**

    <img src="img/Cyclogram.PNG" alt="production-line-automated-control-diagram" loading="lazy" class="prj-image">

    **Scale:** Big

    Absolute beast producing millions of electromechanical switches per year. Automated parts feeding, inbuilt calibration and final quality control. Designed from zero. My impact was in pneumatic system design, mechanics optimisation, algorithm and HMI architecture. Full-scale launch tests and hand over to serial production support included.

- ### **Electro-pneumatical Assembly Jig**

    <img src="img/press.JPG" alt="production-equipment-design-assembly-jig" loading="lazy" class="prj-image">

    **Scale:** Medium

    Typical equipment for automated production lines. Two assembly operations combined on one carriage, inbuilt process quality control, passive and active safety features.

- ### **Stackable Trays for Stationery**

    <img src="img/Tray_2.png" alt="design-stackable-storage-trays" loading="lazy" class="prj-image">

    **Scale:** Hobby

    Prototype of custom trays to carry different kind of stationery. The problem to resolve was limited storage space. Inspired by open-source designs on Thingiverse.com and Printables.com
